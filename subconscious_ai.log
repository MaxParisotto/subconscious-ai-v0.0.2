[2024-06-15T15:28:02Z INFO  subconscious_ai::task_manager] Task processed with result: Redis!
    
    To read data from Redis, you can use the `HGET`, `HKEYS`, or `HVALS` commands.
    
    **Example: Reading a hash**
    
    Suppose you have a Redis hash named "my_hash" with key-value pairs:
    ```
    my_hash:field1:value1
    my_hash:field2:value2
    my_hash:field3:value3
    ```
    You can read the value associated with a specific field using `HGET`:
    ```redis
    HGET my_hash field1
    ```
    This would return the value `"value1"`.
    
    **Example: Reading all fields and values**
    
    To read all key-value pairs in the hash, you can use `HKEYS` to get a list of fields and then iterate over them:
    ```redis
    HKEYS my_hash
    ```
    This would return a list of fields like `["field1", "field2", "field3"]`. Then, you can use `HGET` to read the value for each field.
    
    **Example: Reading all values**
    
    Alternatively, you can use `HVALS` to get a list of all values in the hash:
    ```redis
    HVALS my_hash
    ```
    This would return a list of values like `["value1", "value2", "value3"]`.
    
    Remember that Redis is an in-memory data store, so reading data from Redis is generally very fast and efficient.

[2024-06-15T15:47:33Z INFO  subconscious_ai::task_manager] Task processed with result: Here's an example of how to read data from a Redis database using the Redis client library in Python:
    
    First, install the `redis` package using pip:
    ```
    pip install redis
    ```
    Then, import the `redis` module and create a connection to your Redis instance:
    ```python
    import redis
    
    # Create a connection to the Redis server
    r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
    ```
    Replace `'localhost'`, `6379`, and `0` with the hostname or IP address of your Redis server, the port number you're using (usually 6379), and the database index (usually 0).
    
    Now you can use various methods to read data from Redis:
    
    **Read a string value**
    ```python
    value = r.get('mykey')
    print(value)  # prints the value associated with 'mykey'
    ```
    Replace `'mykey'` with the name of the key you want to retrieve.
    
    **Read an integer value**
    ```python
    value = r.getint('myintegerkey')
    print(value)  # prints the integer value associated with 'myintegerkey'
    ```
    Replace `'myintegerkey'` with the name of the key you want to retrieve. Note that this method assumes the value is a string representation of an integer (e.g., `"123"`).
    
    **Read a hash value**
    ```python
    value = r.hget('myhash', 'field1')
    print(value)  # prints the value associated with 'field1' in the 'myhash' hash
    ```
    Replace `'myhash'` and `'field1'` with the name of the hash key and field you want to retrieve.
    
    **Read a set or sorted set**
    ```python
    values = r.lrange('mymset', 0, -1)
    for value in values:
        print(value)  # prints all elements in 'mymset'
    ```
    Replace `'mymset'` with the name of the set or sorted set you want to retrieve.
    
    These are just a few examples of how to read data from Redis using the `redis` library. You can find more information on the official Redis documentation and the `redis` library's documentation for specific commands and methods.
